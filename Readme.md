# Distributed Systems

This folder contains multiple projects exploring distributed systems concepts such as consensus and state machine replication. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of these concepts through distinct approaches.


## Consensus: Paxos

Paxos is a distributed consensus algorithm ensuring agreement among nodes in a network, even in the presence of faults.

## State Machine Replication

This project includes three implementations of state machine replication:
1. **Non-distributed System**: A single instance managing state transitions locally.
2. **Xuliskov Approach**: Incorporates optimizations for partial replication in distributed settings.
3. **Total Order Sequencer**: A centralized sequencer ensures a consistent global order for all operations.
